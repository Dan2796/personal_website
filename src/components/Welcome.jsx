      <h3>I work as a data scientist for the Labour party, a job I started in September 2023 after completing a PhD in Political Sociology.</h3>
      <h3>Alongside my PhD I taught myself to an advanced level in R, and also picked up a proficient knowledge of C#, Java, Javascript, and other languages along the way just for fun.</h3>
      <h3>I am passionate about programming - the problem solving, the systems thinking, and the learning process itself, have kept me invested these last five years, and I'll keep improving into the future.</h3>
