      <h1>I've done a lot of coding alongside my full-time work.</h1>
      <h3>I completed a number of projects from the Odin Project front-end course, such as making a <a href="https://dansnow.co.uk/calculator/">calculator</a> and designing a simple <a href="https://dansnow.co.uk/etchasketch/">etch-a-sketch.</a></h3>
      <h3>Most years I enjoy the Advent of Code challenges, which are useful for getting up to scratch in a new language, as well as being extremelly fun. I tend to get to around Day 10 before they start to take up too much of my time... (I once spent a full four days trying to solve Day 14!)</h3>
      <h3>You can check out all of my public projects on <a href="https://github.com/Dan2796">GitHub</a>- the front-end ones have live demo links in the README.md.</h3>
